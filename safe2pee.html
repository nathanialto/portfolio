                    <h3>about</h3>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Safe2Pee</strong> was a project I created for the Interactives Section of North By Northwestern. 
                      It is a guide that helps people within the Northwestern University community find 
                      accessible and gender-neutral bathrooms on campus.                    
                    </p>
                    <h4>Figma</h4>
                    <h4>HTML/CSS</h4>
                    <h4>Javascript</h4>
                    <h4>APIs</h4><br>
                    <h3>my role</h3>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Safe2Pee was a solo project, so I designed and developed the guide alone.</strong> I did source much 
                      of the data from Queer@NU and physically visited bathrooms to verify and expand the data 
                      with my co-editor Olivia Lloyd.
                    </p>
                    <h3>problem</h3>
                    <p>
                      As the Northwestern community returned back to campus during the 2021-2022 term, I realized 
                      how difficult it was to find gender-neutral restrooms on campus.                     
                    </p>
                    <h3>solution</h3>
                    <p>
                      With the support of the publication North By Northwestern, my solution was to create a 
                      tool to help the community find gender-neutral and ADA-accessible restrooms at Northwestern that included:                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>an easy-to-use guide accessible to all members of the Northwestern community
                      </li>
                      <li>a visible map that shows all bathrooms on campus</li>
                      <li>a function to identify someone's location so they can find the closest gender-neutral bathrooms near them</li>
                      <li>and connect the data on the textual list with the map</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>early ideation</h3>
                    <p>For the design, I focused on visual simplicity. I wanted to make it colorful so that it felt less 
                      like an app and created a sense of comfort or fun, to signal to users that this isn't just another 
                      site they will come across as they scroll on their computers or phones.
                    </p>
                    <section id="cards" style="padding-top: 0;"> 
                    <section class="card featured-card"><img class="img-div" style="border-radius: 10px;" src="img/safe2pee_wireframe_p1.png"> </section>
                    <section class="card featured-card"><img class="img-div" style="border-radius: 10px;" src="img/safe2pee_wireframe_p2.png"> </section>
                    </section>
                    <p>
                      I used the initial page to explain the tool and display the credits to separate it from the tool itself, 
                      and to give the user a chance to understand it before trying it out. The second page is separated by a 
                      grid that has building locations written in text on the left and a map on the right. 
                    </p>
                    <section id="cards" class="pupusa" style="padding-top: 0;"> 
                      <section class="card featured-card"><img class="img-div" style="border-radius: 10px;" src="img/safe2pee_wireframe_mobile1.png"> </section>
                      <section class="card featured-card"><img class="img-div" style="border-radius: 10px;" src="img/safe2pee_wireframe_mobile2.png"> </section>
                    </section>
                    <p>
                      The mobile design was particularly important because I suspected that the tool would be most widely used 
                      on the move. Due to the program's simple nature, I could easily fit every feature in the mobile version.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>final designs</h3>
                    <p>The final design mostly stayed true to the wireframes. I excluded a search option from the final because 
                      it would have been too difficult to code in and it was unnecessary due to the function of the scrollable 
                      locations and location finder.</p>
                    <section id="cards" class="pupusa" style="flex-direction: center;"> 
                      <section class="card featured-card"><img class="img-div" style="border-radius: 10px;" src="img/safe2pee_mobile1.png"> </section>
                      <section class="card featured-card"><img class="img-div" style="border-radius: 10px;" src="img/safe2pee_mobile2.png"> </section>
                    </section>
                    <p>Safe2Pee effectively included the “use my location” button that called on a function built into Javascript
                       that asks for the location of the device being used in order to find the bathrooms closest to the user on 
                       the map. The user can then click on the map to discover the bathrooms closest to them. </p>

                    <section id="cards" style=" flex-direction: center;"> 
                      <section class="card featured-card"><img class="img-div" style="border-radius: 10px;" src="img/safe2pee_cover.png"> </section>
                      <section class="card featured-card"><img class="img-div" style="border-radius: 10px;" src="img/safe2pee_main.png"> </section>
                    </section>

                    <h3>results</h3>
                    <p>With the help of a fellow North By Northwestern editor who connected us with the disabled students' 
                      community on campus, Safe2Pee was able to increase access to bathrooms for all students. </p>
