        <h3>about</h3>
        <p>
          Safe2Pee was a project I created for the Interactives Section of North By Northwestern.
          It is a guide that helps people within the Northwestern University community find
          accessible and gender-neutral bathrooms on campus.

        <h3>my role</h3>
        <p>
          Safe2Pee was a solo project, so I designed and developed the guide alone. I did source much of the data
          from Queer@NU and physically visited bathrooms to verify and expand the data with my co-editor Olivia Lloyd.
        </p>
        <h3>problem</h3>
        <p>
          As the Northwestern community returned back to campus during the 2021-2022 term, I realized how difficult 
          it was to find gender-neutral restrooms on campus.
        </p>
        <h3>solution</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          With the support of the publication North By Northwestern, my solution was to create a tool to help the
           community find gender-neutral and ADA-accessible restrooms at Northwestern that included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a <strong>sleek, modern design</strong> for the guide that keeps the style 
          of the previous guides and represents the publication well. (purple, easy to use)
          </li>
          <li>Add <strong>accessibility and gender-inclusive information</strong> 
          to meet DEI goals of the publication</li>
          <li>Add new dorms that were missing from previous guides</li>
          <li>Add new descriptions and testimonials from each dorm to 
          reflect the perspective a new generation of students</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>early ideation</h3>
        <p>
          For the design, I focused on visual simplicity. I wanted to make it colorful so 
          that it felt less like an app and created a sense of comfort or fun, to signal to 
          users that this isn't just another site they will come across as they scroll on their 
          computers or phones.
        </p>
        <div class="photo-grid">
          <img src="img/safe2pee_wireframe_p1.png">
          <img src="img/safe2pee_wireframe_p2.png">
        </div>
        <p>
          I used the initial page to explain the tool and display the credits to separate it 
          from the tool itself, and to give the user a chance to understand it before trying it 
          out. The second page is separated by a grid that has building locations written in text 
          on the left and a map on the right.
        </p>
        <div class="photo-grid lead-image">
          <img src="img/safe2pee_wireframe_mobile1.png">
          <img src="img/safe2pee_wireframe_mobile2.png">
        </div>
        <p>
          The mobile design was particularly important because I suspected that the tool 
          would be most widely used on the move. Due to the program's simple nature, I could 
          easily fit every feature in the mobile version.
        </p>
        <h3>final designs</h3>
        <p>
          The final design mostly stayed true to the wireframes. I excluded a search option 
          from the final because it would have been too difficult to code in and it was unnecessary 
          due to the function of the scrollable locations and location finder.
        </p>
        <div class="photo-grid lead-image">
          <img src="img/safe2pee_mobile1.png">
          <img src="img/safe2pee_mobile2.png">
        </div>
        <p>Safe2Pee effectively included the 'find my location' button that called on a 
          function built into Javascript that asks for the location of the device being used in 
          order to find the bathrooms closest to the user on the map. The user can then click on
           the map to discover the bathrooms closest to them.
        </p>
        <div class="photo-grid">
          <img src="img/safe2pee_cover.png">
          <img src="img/safe2pee_main.png">
        </div>
        <h3>results</h3>
        <p>
          With the help of a fellow North By Northwestern editor who connected us with the disabled 
          students' community on campus, Safe2Pee was able to increase access to bathrooms for 
          all students.
