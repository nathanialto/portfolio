                    <h3>about</h3>
                    <p>
                       As an Art Theory and Practice major at Northwestern, I completed 
                       a thesis project in Spring 2022. I created a project based on my 
                       personal, cultural, and familial experiences.                     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My childhood has been uniquely shaped by the care I received and the
                       home that was created by my grandmother. My relationship with my grandmother
                        was unique as it was marked by few words and many acts. She and I represent
                         two points at very different moments within the diasporic experience, yet
                          we have grown a symbiotic, transgenerational love and care for each other
                           over the years. My project reflects, not only this unique dynamic of care
                            but also how this understanding of love influences my life as a young
                             adult and the different types of relationships I encounter as I navigate new spaces.

                       But, I am not a songwriter, so I made this." is a collection of posters, that
                        function almost as a feelings chart. The posters focus on an object or subject
                         and are accompanied by a line of text. My intention was to center the viewer
                          inside of my own mind and inner thoughts, but also emphasize the visual cues
                           that signal nostalgia, comfort, care, and the mundane.

                    <p>"I brought 12 frozen tamales on the plane with me from Oakland to Chicago." includes 
                      objects that I have collected and brought from my own home. The objects exist to recreate
                       the site of a table in the home, as it exists as a place to eat, work, dream, and live. 
                       I wanted to use the gallery space to allow viewers to experience a physical representation
                        of home, through my understanding.</p>

                    </section>

                      <p>I also created a zine and stickers as objects that the viewer could interact with
                        and take with them. I wanted this part of my project to interact with the space and 
                        viewer physically and share with the viewer beyond the white walls of the gallery.

                       burst out at a random station and threw up on the tracks." is a projection of a 
                       drawing of the interior of a BART train. The train is only occupied by two figures:
                        my grandmother and me. The projection of my grandmother and me on the train represents
                         memory but, also the movement through time and space.
