        <h3>about</h3>
        <p>
            Sheridan Rd is a game focused on simulating the experience of walking through the a 
            particularly busy crosswalk on the Northwestern campus. I created Sheridan Rd for my 
            final in the computer science course, Tools and Technology of the World Wide Web. The 
            course was focused on the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        </p>
        <h3>gameplay</h3>
        <p>
            I was inspired by various 2D scrolling games for the gameplay, including Mario and Pokemon. 
            The first part of the gameplay confronts the user with various obstacles as they walk through 
            the road and the second is when they are confronted by an obstacle and forced to "battle." 
            Although the player confronts a "You Lose" screen if they lose all of their health points in 
            battle, the game is mostly continuous and has no set end point.

        <h3>code</h3>
        <p>
            The game utilized P5.JS for the 2D scrolling part, as the player dodges the obstacles. I used this 
            in order to allow the player to move on screen and for functions to occur when they do confront an 
            opponent. P5.JS allowed me to create this dynamic gameplay that is not possible in Vanilla Javascript. 
            The rest of the game was mostly coded in HTML/CSS/JS, including functions that ran the battle that allowed 
            the code to keep track of health, decide the amount of damage taken with a level of randomness, and that 
            determined if a player lost or continued.

        <p>
            I drew all of the opponents and player icon in Procreate. This allowed me to feature my art and my coding 
            skills in this project.
