                <h4>My name is Nathanial Ortiz and I am a second
                year student at Northwestern University majoring in Art
                Theory and Practice. I love creating, and art has always 
                given me the platform to be able to convey the whimsical 
                and complicated ideas that are shaped in my head. 
                </h4>
                <h4>
                As I have explore creatively, my interest in the digital
                space has only grown. This is reflected in my practice as I 
                have focused on illustration and web design/development. Technology
                not only makes art more accesible, but also allows for new levels
                of interactivity and contribution. 
                </h4>
                <h4>
                I hope to continue to focus on the visual composition of 
                my work as well as its dynamic, interactive, and animative aspects, as well.
