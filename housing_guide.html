    <h3>about</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The North By Northwestern Housing Guide</strong> has been a very popular 
      project for Northwestern students and is the most viewed and well-known project that the 
      publication has published. The guide functions as a catalog of every student housing 
      option on campus.
    </p>

      <strong>Team: Nathanial Ortiz and Olivia Lloyd (my co-editor, best friend, 
      and great journalist)</strong>

    <h3>my role</h3>
    <p>
      As co-editor of the Interactives Section of North By Northwestern, I co-led an update 
      of the popular housing guide in spring 2022. I worked with my co-editor and 
      <strong>mainly focused on the design and programming of the project</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3>solution</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      The housing situation had changed greatly in the previous few years so we decided 
      to do a <strong>complete re-haul of the guide</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a <strong>sleek, modern design</strong> for the guide that keeps the style 
      of the previous guides and represents the publication well. (purple, easy to use)
      </li>
      <li>Add <strong>accessibility and gender-inclusive information</strong> 
      to meet DEI goals of the publication</li>
      <li>Add new dorms that were missing from previous guides</li>
      <li>Add new descriptions and testimonials from each dorm to 
      reflect the perspective a new generation of students</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>early ideation</h3>
    <p>
      I began the design with that of the previous year's guide. I also designed 
      the 2021 version, but did not develop it. Now that I had full control of the 
      visual and technical sides of the project, I was able to create a design that 
      was easy to transfer to HTML/CSS and I was able to carry out my design 
      vision through the code.

    <p>
      The 2021 version needed more visual cohesion. It didn't add from previous 
      versions and was a bit messy. I wanted to focus on and create a visually pleasing, 
      simple, and easy-to-read version while keeping the essence of my original vision. 
      My original wireframes were very bare, due in part to the fact that I was also 
      developing the guide at the same time and was able to work on the code and design 
      at the same time to work more cohesively between the two tasks. I was able to 
      alter the design to the constraints and needs of the code and vice versa.

    <h3>final designs</h3>
    <p>
      The Final Design focused greatly on <strong>mobile integration</strong>, 
      I wanted the guide to be as easy to use and aesthetic as it was on a computer, as a phone. 
      We had the assumption that a lot of people, if not most, would be looking 
      at the guide on their phones and wanted to accommodate that. This included 
      creating text and icons that worked well on both large and small screens and 
      knowing how to rework the design for each screen size. I also didn't 
      compromise any functionality on the mobile version.

    <p>
      I wanted the desktop version to display as much information to the user without
      them having to scroll. The guide includes a ton of information, so I wanted to 
      streamline the way they use it as much as possible. I did this by creating a tight, 
      high-contrast design that allows the user to skim and understand the guide at first 
      glance.

      The dorm pages display key information at the left with visual elements that 
      are standard to each page and create a <strong>sense of visual cohesion</strong> 
      throughout the guide. They also have a longer more comprehensive description
      and testimonials, as well as photos that allow a user to skim or research as 
      much as they want about each dorm.
    </p>

    <h3>results</h3>
    <p>
      The guide was released at a critical time at Northwestern, with a ton of 
      new dorms. We were able to update all of the content of the guide to reflect 
      the state of residential life at Northwestern at the time, as well as enhance
      the user interface and experience in a way that was able to accommodate all 
      types of students who are using the guide. We focused this year's guide on 
      having a DEI focus and creating a guide that would focus on all students at 
      Northwestern, and how their needs may differ when it comes to housing.
