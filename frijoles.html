        <h3>about</h3>
        <p>
            I made "Forking Frijoles" for my final in Web Convergence. 
            The project synthesized months of work I put into learning how to make beans like my grandma. 
            I wanted to recreate this experience and share cultural knowledge in a playful yet generative way. 
            The project was built in HTML and CSS, and featured my illustration.
        </p>

        <h3>gameplay</h3>
        <p>
            The game uses a playful, comedic tone as it teaches the user how to make frijoles. I use my own experience
            with learning how to make beans from my grandma, aunt, and trial-and-error. The gameplay relfects my own 
            experience of reproducing aspects of culture at a distance from my family and community.
        </p>

        <h3>code</h3>
        <p>
            I heavily utilized HTML and CSS to make this game, as well as a bit of Javascript
            to show the player which answers were correct and incorrect as they answer each of the questions.
        </p>
        <h3>illustration</h3>
        <p>
            I created a lot of illustrations for this piece, including some that were GIFS/animated in Procreate. 
            This helped set the tone of the project and gave it another layer of personality.
